# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Revenue-Department-Certificate-Issuance-Real-Time-Evaluation-and-Monitoring

Abstract:
The application aims to streamline the process of certificate issuance, verification, and renewal through an automated system. The user interface is developed using React to handle login, certificate selection, and form submission, with data stored securely in MySQL. APIs in Node.js facilitate authentication, form processing, and ensure secure data transfer with encryption and compliance to data protection standards. A Python and Flask-based verification module is employed to detect fake or mismatched certificates by extracting and comparing PDF data using PyPDF2. The system automates the renewal process by extracting expiry dates via Tesseract OCR and sending reminders through Twilio using the Schedule library. Certificate statuses are tracked, and for real-time monitoring, data analytics with charts are generated using React and Node.js. Additionally, a view page sends detailed certificate information to the Revenue Department. Lastly, certificates are auto-generated using PyPDF2 and ReportLab, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in handling documentation.
